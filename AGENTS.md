# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Version-controlled: Built on Dolt with cell-level merge
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking and [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) (`bv`) for graph-aware triage. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). Instead of parsing JSONL or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). `br` handles creating, modifying, and closing beads.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY --robot-* flags. Bare bv launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

# Token-optimized output (TOON) for lower LLM context usage:
bv --robot-triage --format toon
```

#### Other bv Commands

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |

#### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
```

### br Commands for Issue Management

```bash
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export DB to JSONL
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Triage**: Run `bv --robot-triage` to find the highest-impact actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `br sync --flush-only` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers 0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads changes to JSONL
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything
git push                # Push to remote
```
