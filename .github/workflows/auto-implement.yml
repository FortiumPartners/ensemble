          ## Auto-Implemented via Ensemble Pipeline

          This PR was automatically generated using the full Ensemble workflow from issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}.

          ### Pipeline Phases
          1. **PRD** — \`/ensemble:create-prd\` → \`docs/PRD/issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md\`
          2. **TRD** — \`/ensemble:create-trd\` → \`docs/TRD/issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md\`
          3. **Implementation** — \`/ensemble:implement-trd\`

          ### Source Issue
          Closes #${ISSUE_NUMBER}

          ### ⚠️ Review Required
          This is AI-generated code. Please review the PRD, TRD, and implementation carefully before merging.
