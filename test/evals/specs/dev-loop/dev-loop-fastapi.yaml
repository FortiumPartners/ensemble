  Test the complete development loop cycle for FastAPI endpoint implementation:

  1. IMPLEMENT: Read story.md and implement Todo List API with Pydantic models
  2. VERIFY: Delegate to @verify-app to run tests and report coverage
  3. SIMPLIFY: Delegate to @code-simplifier to refactor while preserving tests
  4. VERIFY: Delegate to @verify-app again to confirm tests still pass

  This eval measures whether agent delegation improves the quality and
  consistency of the full development workflow for FastAPI applications.

  Uses variant-based fixture structure for proper A/B testing:
  - framework variant: Full Ensemble with agents, skills, and commands
  - baseline variant: Vanilla Claude without framework assistance

# Test fixture configuration (per-variant fixture paths)

  repo: ensemble-vnext-test-fixtures
  # Note: path is now per-variant, see variants[].fixture_path

    Complete this task using the full development loop:

    ## STEP 1 - IMPLEMENT
    Read the story.md file and implement a Todo List API with FastAPI.

    Requirements:
    - GET /todos - List all todos
    - POST /todos - Create a new todo
    - PUT /todos/{id} - Update a todo
    - DELETE /todos/{id} - Delete a todo
    - Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
    - Include proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 422)
    - Use type hints throughout

    ## STEP 2 - VERIFY (Initial)
    Run tests to verify the implementation works correctly.
    Report test results and coverage metrics.
    Target: >= 80% unit test coverage.

    ## STEP 3 - SIMPLIFY
    Review the code for potential simplifications:
    - Reduce complexity where possible
    - Improve readability and organization
    - Extract common patterns
    - Ensure proper separation of concerns

    ## STEP 4 - VERIFY (Final)
    Run tests again to confirm all tests still pass after simplification.
    Report final coverage metrics.

# Variants to compare using variant-based fixture structure
variants:

    name: Full Ensemble Framework
    description: Use agent delegation pattern with full framework support
    fixture_path: variants/full/taskflow-api
    suffix: |
      Use the full Ensemble workflow. You have access to commands, skills, and agents.

      Use the agent delegation pattern for each step:

      For STEP 2 and STEP 4 (VERIFY):
        Delegate to @verify-app agent for test execution.
        Request: Run pytest with coverage, test all API endpoints.

      For STEP 3 (SIMPLIFY):
        Delegate to @code-simplifier agent for refactoring.
        Request: Simplify the FastAPI implementation while preserving API behavior.

      Use the appropriate skills:
      - developing-with-python for Python/FastAPI patterns
      - pytest for test execution

      Report which agents and skills you used at each step.
    agent_enabled: true
    skill_enabled: true
    timeout_seconds: 600
    expected_agents:
      - verify-app
      - code-simplifier
    expected_skills:
      - developing-with-python
      - pytest

    is_baseline: true
    suffix: |
      Implement directly without any framework assistance.

      Complete all steps directly without delegating to any agents.

      For STEP 2 and STEP 4 (VERIFY):
        Run pytest directly: python -m pytest -v --cov --cov-report=term
        Test each endpoint: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
        Report pass/fail counts and coverage percentage.

      For STEP 3 (SIMPLIFY):
        Apply refactoring patterns directly to improve code quality.
        Ensure tests still pass after changes.

      Do not use any agents, skills, or commands from the framework.
