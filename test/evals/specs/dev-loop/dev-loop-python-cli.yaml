  Test the complete development loop cycle for Python CLI implementation:

  1. IMPLEMENT: Delegate to @backend-implementer to build from story.md
  2. VERIFY: Delegate to @verify-app to run tests and report coverage
  3. SIMPLIFY: Delegate to @code-simplifier to refactor while preserving tests
  4. VERIFY: Delegate to @verify-app again to confirm tests still pass

  This eval measures whether agent delegation improves the quality and
  consistency of the full development workflow compared to direct implementation.

  Three test variants:
  - baseline: Vanilla Claude without framework assistance
  - framework: Full Ensemble with agents and skills (implement + verify + simplify)
  - full-workflow: PRD → TRD → implement-trd orchestrated workflow

    Complete this task using the full development loop:

    ## STEP 1 - IMPLEMENT
    Read the story.md file in this directory and implement the requirements.
    The existing calc.py provides a starting point - review it and ensure it meets
    all requirements including comprehensive error handling.

    ## STEP 2 - VERIFY (Initial)
    Run tests to verify the implementation works correctly.
    Report test results and coverage metrics.
    Target: >= 80% unit test coverage.

    ## STEP 3 - SIMPLIFY
    Review the code for potential simplifications:
    - Reduce complexity where possible
    - Improve readability
    - Remove any duplication
    - Ensure functions are appropriately sized

    ## STEP 4 - VERIFY (Final)
    Run tests again to confirm all tests still pass after simplification.
    Report final coverage metrics.

    Requirements for the CLI calculator:
    - Accept command line arguments: <number1> <operator> <number2>
    - Support operators: +, -, *, /
    - Handle division by zero gracefully
    - Provide clear error messages for invalid input
    - Include type hints throughout the code
    - Write comprehensive tests using pytest

      Implement directly without any framework assistance.

      Complete all steps directly without delegating to any agents.

      For STEP 1 (IMPLEMENT):
        Implement the Python CLI calculator directly based on story.md requirements.

      For STEP 2 and STEP 4 (VERIFY):
        Run pytest directly: python -m pytest -v --cov=calc --cov-report=term
        Report pass/fail counts and coverage percentage.

      For STEP 3 (SIMPLIFY):
        Apply refactoring patterns directly to improve code quality.
        Ensure tests still pass after changes.

      Do not use any agents, skills, or commands from the framework.

    skill_enabled: false

  - id: framework
    name: Full Ensemble Framework with Agent Delegation
    description: Use agent delegation pattern for ALL steps including implementation
    fixture_path: variants/full/python-cli
    suffix: |
      Use the full Ensemble workflow with agent delegation for EVERY step.

      For STEP 1 (IMPLEMENT):
        Delegate to @backend-implementer agent for initial implementation.
        Request: Read story.md and implement the Python CLI calculator with tests.
        The agent should handle all implementation including error handling and tests.

      For STEP 2 and STEP 4 (VERIFY):
        Delegate to @verify-app agent for test execution.
        Request: Run pytest with coverage, report results against 80% threshold.

      For STEP 3 (SIMPLIFY):
        Delegate to @code-simplifier agent for refactoring.
        Request: Simplify the implementation while preserving test behavior.

      Use the appropriate skills:
      - developing-with-python for implementation patterns
      - pytest for test execution

      Report which agents and skills you used at each step.
    agent_enabled: true
    skill_enabled: true
    timeout_seconds: 600
    expected_agents:
      - backend-implementer

  - id: full-workflow
    name: Full PRD → TRD → implement-trd Workflow
    description: Use the complete structured workflow with upfront design
    fixture_path: variants/full/python-cli
    suffix: |
      Use the full structured workflow with upfront design artifacts.

      BEFORE implementing, create the design artifacts:

      1. Run /create-prd to generate a Product Requirements Document
         Input: Use the story.md as the product description.
         Output: docs/PRD/calculator.md

      2. Run /create-trd to generate a Technical Requirements Document
         Input: Use the PRD just created.
         Output: docs/TRD/calculator.md

      3. Run /implement-trd to execute the implementation
         This should orchestrate the full dev loop with TDD methodology:
         - Use @backend-implementer for implementation
         - Use @verify-app for test verification
         - Use @code-simplifier for refactoring
         - Track progress in .trd-state/

      The implement-trd command should handle STEPS 1-4 automatically using
      the TRD execution plan and agent delegation.

      Report which commands, agents, and skills were used throughout.

# Judge configuration
judge:
  model: opus
  use_cot: true

  system_prompt: |
    You are evaluating the quality of a complete development loop execution:
    implement -> verify -> simplify -> verify

    This tests whether the full cycle produces better results with agent delegation
    versus direct implementation. Consider:

    1. Implementation quality: Does the code meet requirements?
    2. Test quality: Are tests comprehensive and well-structured?
    3. Simplification quality: Did refactoring improve readability?
    4. Process completion: Were all four steps executed?

    Score each metric on a 1-5 scale according to the provided rubric.
    Output JSON: {"scores": {"metric_name": {"score": N, "justification": "..."}}}
