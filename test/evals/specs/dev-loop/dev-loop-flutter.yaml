  Test the complete development loop cycle for Flutter widget implementation:

  1. IMPLEMENT: Delegate to @mobile-implementer to build from story.md Counter Widget with color changes
  2. VERIFY: Delegate to @verify-app to run flutter test and report coverage
  3. SIMPLIFY: Delegate to @code-simplifier to refactor while preserving tests
  4. VERIFY: Delegate to @verify-app again to confirm tests still pass

  This eval measures whether agent delegation improves the quality and
  consistency of the full development workflow for Flutter applications.

  Three test variants:
  - baseline: Vanilla Claude without framework assistance
  - framework: Full Ensemble with agents and skills (implement + verify + simplify)
  - full-workflow: PRD -> TRD -> implement-trd orchestrated workflow

    Complete this task using the full development loop:

    ## STEP 1 - IMPLEMENT
    Read the story.md file and implement a Counter Widget in Flutter.

    Requirements:
    - Create a counter widget with increment and decrement buttons
    - Display the current counter value
    - Change color based on value:
      - Green when positive
      - Red when negative
      - Grey when zero
    - Use proper Flutter widget composition
    - Include appropriate state management (StatefulWidget or provider)

    Create the following structure:
    - lib/counter_widget.dart - The counter widget implementation
    - test/counter_widget_test.dart - Widget tests

    ## STEP 2 - VERIFY (Initial)
    Run widget tests to verify the implementation works correctly.
    Command: flutter test
    Report test results and any failures.

    ## STEP 3 - SIMPLIFY
    Review the widget code for potential simplifications:
    - Reduce widget complexity
    - Extract reusable components if appropriate
    - Improve widget composition
    - Ensure proper separation of concerns

    ## STEP 4 - VERIFY (Final)
    Run tests again to confirm all tests still pass after simplification.
    Report final test results.

      Implement directly without any framework assistance.

      Complete all steps directly without delegating to any agents.

      For STEP 1 (IMPLEMENT):
        Implement the Flutter Counter Widget directly based on story.md requirements.

      For STEP 2 and STEP 4 (VERIFY):
        Run flutter test directly.
        Verify increment, decrement, and color change behavior.
        Report pass/fail counts.

      For STEP 3 (SIMPLIFY):
        Apply Flutter widget refactoring patterns directly.
        Consider extracting components or improving composition.
        Ensure tests still pass after changes.

      Do not use any agents, skills, or commands from the framework.
    agent_enabled: false
    skill_enabled: false
    timeout_seconds: 900
    expected_agents: []
    expected_skills: []

  - id: framework
    name: Full Ensemble Framework with Agent Delegation
    description: Use agent delegation pattern for ALL steps including implementation
    fixture_path: variants/full/flutter-widget
    suffix: |
      Use the full Ensemble workflow with agent delegation for EVERY step.

      For STEP 1 (IMPLEMENT):
        Delegate to @mobile-implementer agent for initial implementation.
        Request: Read story.md and implement the Flutter Counter Widget with:
        - Increment/decrement buttons
        - Color changes based on value (green/red/grey)
        - Comprehensive widget tests

      For STEP 2 and STEP 4 (VERIFY):
        Delegate to @verify-app agent for test execution.
        Request: Run flutter test, verify widget behavior and color changes.

      For STEP 3 (SIMPLIFY):
        Delegate to @code-simplifier agent for refactoring.
        Request: Simplify the widget implementation while preserving test behavior.

      Use the developing-with-flutter skill for Flutter patterns and best practices.

      Report which agents and skills you used at each step.
    agent_enabled: true
    skill_enabled: true
    timeout_seconds: 900
    expected_agents:
      - mobile-implementer
      - verify-app
      - code-simplifier
    expected_skills:
      - developing-with-flutter

  - id: full-workflow
    name: Full PRD -> TRD -> implement-trd Workflow
    description: Use the complete structured workflow with upfront design
    fixture_path: variants/full/flutter-widget
    suffix: |
      Use the full structured workflow with upfront design artifacts.

      BEFORE implementing, create the design artifacts:

      1. Run /create-prd to generate a Product Requirements Document
         Input: Use the story.md as the product description.
         Output: docs/PRD/counter-widget.md

      2. Run /create-trd to generate a Technical Requirements Document
         Input: Use the PRD just created.
         Output: docs/TRD/counter-widget.md

      3. Run /implement-trd to execute the implementation
         This should orchestrate the full dev loop with TDD methodology:
         - Use @mobile-implementer for implementation
         - Use @verify-app for test verification
         - Use @code-simplifier for refactoring
         - Track progress in .trd-state/

      The implement-trd command should handle STEPS 1-4 automatically using
      the TRD execution plan and agent delegation.

      Report which commands, agents, and skills were used throughout.
    agent_enabled: true

    expected_commands:
