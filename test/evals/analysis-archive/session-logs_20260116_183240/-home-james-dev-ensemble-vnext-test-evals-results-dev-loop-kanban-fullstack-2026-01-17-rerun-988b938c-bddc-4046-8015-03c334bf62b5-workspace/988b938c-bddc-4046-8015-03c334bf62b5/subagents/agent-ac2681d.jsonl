Header with version, status, author, source PRD, task ID prefix\n2. Changelog\n3. Overview (technical summary, key decisions, tech stack, integration points)\n4. System Architecture (diagrams, component details, data flow, state management)\n5. Technical Specifications (API contracts, database schema, component specs)\n6. Master Task List (all tasks with KB-prefix IDs, dependencies, acceptance criteria)\n7. Execution Plan (phases, sessions, parallelization map, critical path)\n8. Quality Requirements (testing, code quality, security, performance)\n9. Risk Assessment (imported from PRD + technical risks)\n10. Non-Goals (copied from PRD)\n11. Appendices (file structure, API contracts)\n\n**Output**: Write the complete TRD to `docs/TRD/kanban-board.md`\n\nUse ultrathink to deeply analyze the architecture before writing. This is a complex full-stack application requiring careful planning of task dependencies and parallelization opportunities."},"uuid":"f4046244-cec9-4503-9a94-bb6a0c051c62","timestamp":"2026-01-17T01:15:00.370Z"}

The application allows users to create boards, organize tasks into columns, and drag-and-drop cards between columns.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks\n- **Backend**: Node.js with Express\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL\n- **Data Grid**: AG Grid Community for reporting views\n- **Testing**: Jest for both frontend and backend\n- **Container**: Docker Compose for local development\n\n## Features\n\n### Core Features\n\n1. **Boards** - Create, view, update, and delete boards\n2. **Columns** - Add columns to boards (e.g., \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", \"Done\")\n3. **Cards** - Create task cards with title and description\n4. **Drag-and-Drop** - Move cards between columns and reorder within columns\n5. **Persistence** - All data stored in PostgreSQL\n6. **Reports** - Analytics dashboard with AG Grid for task reporting and metrics\n\n### User Stories\n\nAs a user, I want to:\n- Create a new board with a name\n- Add columns to organize my tasks\n- Create cards in any column\n- Edit card details (title, description)\n- Drag cards between columns to update status\n- Reorder cards within a column by priority\n- Delete cards I no longer need\n- Delete columns (with all contained cards)\n- Delete entire boards when projects are complete\n- View a reports dashboard showing all tasks across boards\n- Filter and sort tasks in a data grid by status, board, date\n- Export task data to CSV from the reports view\n- See summary metrics (total cards, cards per status, cards per board)\n\n## Architecture\n\n### File Structure\n\n```\nkanban-board/\n├── docker-compose.yml\n├── backend/\n│   ├── package.json\n│   ├── .env.example\n│   ├── src/\n│   │   ├── index.js              # Express app entry point\n│   │   ├── routes/\n│   │   │   ├── boards.js         # Board CRUD routes\n│   │   │   ├── columns.js        # Column CRUD routes\n│   │   │   └── cards.js          # Card CRUD + move routes\n│   │   ├── models/\n│   │   │   ├── Board.js          # Board model/queries\n│   │   │   ├── Column.js         # Column model/queries\n│   │   │   └── Card.js           # Card model/queries\n│   │   ├── db/\n│   │   │   ├── index.js          # Database connection pool\n│   │   │   └── migrations/\n│   │   │       └── 001_initial.sql\n│   │   └── middleware/\n│   │       └── errorHandler.js   # Centralized error handling\n│   └── tests/\n│       ├── boards.test.js\n│       ├── columns.test.js\n│       └── cards.test.js\n└── frontend/\n    ├── package.json\n    ├── vite.config.js\n    ├── index.html\n    ├── src/\n    │   ├── main.jsx\n    │   ├── App.jsx\n    │   ├── components/\n    │   │   ├── Board.jsx         # Main board container\n    │   │   ├── Column.jsx        # Column with card list\n    │   │   ├── Card.jsx          # Draggable card\n    │   │   ├── CardModal.jsx     # Card edit modal\n    │   │   ├── AddCardForm.jsx   # Quick add card form\n    │   │   └── reports/\n    │   │       ├── ReportsDashboard.jsx  # Reports main view\n    │   │       ├── TasksGrid.jsx         # AG Grid task table\n    │   │       └── MetricsSummary.jsx    # Summary cards\n    │   ├── hooks/\n    │   │   ├── useBoard.js       # Board state management\n    │   │   ├── useApi.js         # API fetch wrapper\n    │   │   ├── useDragDrop.js    # Drag-and-drop logic\n    │   │   └── useReports.js     # Reports data fetching\n    │   └── styles/\n    │       ├── kanban.css\n    │       └── reports.css\n    └── tests/\n        ├── Board.test.jsx\n        └── Card.test.jsx\n```\n\n## Database Schema\n\n### Tables\n\n```sql\n-- boards: Top-level organization unit\nCREATE TABLE boards (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- columns: Belongs to a board, holds cards\nCREATE TABLE columns (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    board_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    position FLOAT NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- cards: Belongs to a column\nCREATE TABLE cards (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    column_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES columns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    description TEXT,\n    position FLOAT NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Indexes for performance\nCREATE INDEX idx_columns_board_id ON columns(board_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_columns_position ON columns(board_id, position);\nCREATE INDEX idx_cards_column_id ON cards(column_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_cards_position ON cards(column_id, position);\n```\n\n### Position Management\n\nUse fractional indexing for card/column ordering:\n\n- **New item at end**: `position = last_position + 1024`\n- **Insert between items**: `position = (prev_position + next_position) / 2`\n- **First item**: `position = 1024`\n- **Rebalance threshold**: When positions get too close (diff < 1), rebalance all positions in the container\n\n## API Specification\n\n### Base URL\n\n`http://localhost:3001/api`\n\n### Endpoints\n\n#### Boards\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request Body | Response |\n|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|\n| GET | /boards | List all boards | -

Overview\n\n### 1.1 Technical Summary\n\nThis TRD defines the technical implementation for a full-stack Kanban task management application. The system consists of three main components:\n\n1. **React SPA Frontend** - Vite-powered React 18 application with drag-and-drop functionality and AG Grid integration\n2. **Express Backend API** - RESTful API server handling all CRUD operations with PostgreSQL\n3. **PostgreSQL Database** - Persistent storage with fractional indexing for efficient position management\n\nThe architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns, testability, and developer experience through Docker Compose orchestration.\n\n### 1.2 Key Technical Decisions\n\n| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |\n|----------|-----------|------------------------|\n| **Fractional indexing for positions** | Avoids reindexing entire lists on reorder; O(1) position updates | Integer positions (requires reindex), linked lists (complex queries) |\n| **HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API** | Native browser support, no dependencies | @dnd-kit (fallback if needed), react-beautiful-dnd (deprecated) |\n| **AG Grid Community** | Enterprise-grade grid features, free tier sufficient | React Table (less features), DataGrid (MUI dependency) |\n| **Express over Fastify** | Wider ecosystem, team familiarity | Fastify (faster), Hapi (more structured) |\n| **Vite over CRA** | Faster HMR, modern ESM support | Create React App (slower, maintenance mode) |\n| **PostgreSQL over SQLite** | Better concurrency, JSON support, industry standard | SQLite (simpler), MySQL (less feature-rich) |\n\n### 1.3 Technology Stack\n\n| Layer | Technology | Version | Purpose |\n|-------|------------|---------|---------|\n| **Frontend** | React | 18.x | UI framework |\n| **Build Tool** | Vite | 5.x | Development server and bundler |\n| **Data Grid** | AG Grid Community | Latest | Reports dashboard |\n| **Backend** | Express | 4.x | HTTP server and routing |\n| **Database** | PostgreSQL | 15.x | Persistent storage |\n| **ORM/Query** | pg (node-postgres) | Latest | Database client |\n| **Testing** | Jest | 29.x | Unit and integration tests |\n| **Testing (FE)** | React Testing Library | Latest | Component testing |\n| **Container** | Docker Compose | 3.8 | Development orchestration |\n\n### 1.4 Integration Points\n\n| Integration | Protocol | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|---------|\n| Frontend <-> Backend | REST/HTTP | All data operations |\n| Backend <-> Database | TCP/pg | Data persistence |\n| AG Grid <-> Reports API | REST/HTTP | Task data for grid |\n| Docker Compose | Container networking | Service orchestration |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Infrastructure setup (Docker, database)\n2. Card model with fractional indexing\n3. Card move logic\n4. Drag-and-drop hook\n5. Card movement between columns\n6. Optimistic updates\n7. Drag-and-drop testing\n8. Frontend coverage verification\n9. End-to-end verification\n\n### 5.5 Parallel Execution Opportunities\n\n| Parallel Group | Tasks | Rationale |\n|----------------|-------|-----------|\n| **Infrastructure** | KB-P003, KB-P004 | Backend and frontend init are independent |\n| **Models** | KB-B001, KB-B003, KB-B005 | All models depend on KB-P005, independent of each other |\n| **Routes** | KB-B002, KB-B004, KB-B006 | Routes depend on their models, independent of each other |\n| **Frontend Core** | KB-F007, KB-F008 | Modal and AddCardForm are independent after KB-F005 |\n| **Reports Components** | KB-F020-KB-F023, KB-F024 | Grid features and metrics are independent after KB-F018 |\n| **Backend Tests** | KB-T001-KB-T008 | All backend tests can run in parallel |\n| **Frontend Tests** | KB-T010-KB-T015 | All frontend tests can run in parallel |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quality Requirements\n\n### 6.1 Testing Requirements\n\n| Category | Requirement | Target | Verification |\n|----------|-------------|--------|--------------|\n| Backend Unit Tests | Model and utility tests | >= 80% coverage | Jest --coverage |\n| Backend Integration Tests | API endpoint tests | All endpoints covered | Jest with supertest |\n| Frontend Unit Tests | Component tests | >= 70% coverage | Jest --coverage |\n| Frontend Integration Tests | Hook integration tests | Critical paths covered | React Testing Library |\n\n### 6.2 Code Quality Standards\n\n| Standard | Requirement | Enforcement |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Linting | ESLint with recommended rules | Pre-commit hook |\n| Formatting | Prettier | Pre-commit hook |\n| Type Safety | JSDoc annotations for complex functions | Code review |\n| Documentation | README, API docs, inline comments | Code review |\n\n### 6.3 Security Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Implementation | Verification |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------|\n| SQL Injection Prevention | Parameterized queries only | Code review |\n| XSS Prevention | React auto-escaping, sanitize user input | Code review |\n| CORS Configuration | Whitelist frontend origin only | Integration test |\n| Error Information Leakage | No stack traces in production errors | Integration test |\n| Input Validation | Validate all request bodies | Unit tests |\n\n### 6.4 Performance Requirements\n\n| Metric | Target | Measurement |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| API Response Time | < 200ms for CRUD operations | Integration test timing |\n| Drag-and-Drop Latency | < 100ms UI feedback | Manual testing |\n| Reports Grid Load | < 2s for 1000 rows | Performance test with seed data |\n| Initial Page Load | < 3s on local network | Lighthouse audit |\n| Database Queries | < 50ms per query | Query logging |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Risk Assessment\n\n### 7.1 PRD Risks with Technical Mitigations\n\n| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Technical Mitigation |\n|----|------|------------|--------|---------------------|\n| R1 | Drag-and-drop complexity with HTML5 API | Medium | High | Implement fallback to @dnd-kit library if HTML5 DnD proves insufficient; create abstraction layer in useDragDrop hook |\n| R2 | Fractional indexing precision limits | Low | Medium | Implement automatic position rebalancing when diff < 0.001; use FLOAT for positions with sufficient precision |\n| R3 | AG Grid learning curve | Medium | Low | Follow official AG Grid React documentation; start with basic configuration, add features incrementally |\n| R4 | Docker networking issues on different platforms | Medium | Medium | Test on Linux, macOS, Windows during development; document known issues and workarounds; use standard Docker networking |\n| R5 | Test coverage targets not met | Medium | Medium | Write tests alongside implementation (TDD approach); use Jest coverage reports for tracking; create dedicated testing phase |\n\n### 7.2 Technical Risks\n\n| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|----|------|------------|--------|------------|\n| TR1 | Database connection pool exhaustion | Low | High | Configure appropriate pool size (10-20 connections); implement connection timeout; add health checks |\n| TR2 | Frontend state synchronization issues | Medium | Medium | Implement optimistic updates with rollback; use single source of truth pattern; add error boundaries |\n| TR3 | CORS misconfiguration blocking requests | Low | High | Test CORS configuration early in development; document allowed origins; add CORS debugging middleware |\n| TR4 | AG Grid bundle size impact | Low | Medium | Use AG Grid Community (smaller than Enterprise); implement code splitting for reports route |\n| TR5 | Position rebalance transaction failures | Low | Medium | Wrap rebalance in database transaction; add retry logic; implement position validation |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Non-Goals\n\nThe following are explicitly out of scope for this implementation. Implementation agents will reference this list to reject scope creep.\n\n| ID | Non-Goal | Rationale |\n|----|----------|-----------|\n| NG1 | User authentication/authorization | MVP focuses on single-user local deployment |\n| NG2 | Real-time collaboration/WebSockets | Adds complexity; not needed for single-user |\n| NG3 | Mobile-native applications | Web responsive is sufficient for MVP |\n| NG4 | Cloud deployment configurations | Focus is local Docker development |\n| NG5 | Card attachments/file uploads | Adds storage complexity; defer to future version |\n| NG6 | Due dates, labels, or card metadata beyond title/description | Keep MVP simple; extend later |\n| NG7 | Board templates or column presets | Users can create columns manually |\n| NG8 | Undo/redo functionality | Standard browser back not sufficient; complex to implement |\n| NG9 | Keyboard shortcuts for drag-and-drop | Mouse/touch is sufficient for MVP |\n| NG10 | Dark mode or theme customization | Single light theme for MVP |\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Overview\n\n### 1.1 Technical Summary\n\nThis TRD defines the technical implementation for a full-stack Kanban task management application. The system consists of three main components:\n\n1. **React SPA Frontend** - Vite-powered React 18 application with drag-and-drop functionality and AG Grid integration\n2. **Express Backend API** - RESTful API server handling all CRUD operations with PostgreSQL\n3. **PostgreSQL Database** - Persistent storage with fractional indexing for efficient position management\n\nThe architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns, testability, and developer experience through Docker Compose orchestration.\n\n### 1.2 Key Technical Decisions\n\n| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |\n|----------|-----------|------------------------|\n| **Fractional indexing for positions** | Avoids reindexing entire lists on reorder; O(1) position updates | Integer positions (requires reindex), linked lists (complex queries) |\n| **HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API** | Native browser support, no dependencies | @dnd-kit (fallback if needed), react-beautiful-dnd (deprecated) |\n| **AG Grid Community** | Enterprise-grade grid features, free tier sufficient | React Table (less features), DataGrid (MUI dependency) |\n| **Express over Fastify** | Wider ecosystem, team familiarity | Fastify (faster), Hapi (more structured) |\n| **Vite over CRA** | Faster HMR, modern ESM support | Create React App (slower, maintenance mode) |\n| **PostgreSQL over SQLite** | Better concurrency, JSON support, industry standard | SQLite (simpler), MySQL (less feature-rich) |\n\n### 1.3 Technology Stack\n\n| Layer | Technology | Version | Purpose |\n|-------|------------|---------|---------|\n| **Frontend** | React | 18.x | UI framework |\n| **Build Tool** | Vite | 5.x | Development server and bundler |\n| **Data Grid** | AG Grid Community | Latest | Reports dashboard |\n| **Backend** | Express | 4.x | HTTP server and routing |\n| **Database** | PostgreSQL | 15.x | Persistent storage |\n| **ORM/Query** | pg (node-postgres) | Latest | Database client |\n| **Testing** | Jest | 29.x | Unit and integration tests |\n| **Testing (FE)** | React Testing Library | Latest | Component testing |\n| **Container** | Docker Compose | 3.8 | Development orchestration |\n\n### 1.4 Integration Points\n\n| Integration | Protocol | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|---------|\n| Frontend <-> Backend | REST/HTTP | All data operations |\n| Backend <-> Database | TCP/pg | Data persistence |\n| AG Grid <-> Reports API | REST/HTTP | Task data for grid |\n| Docker Compose | Container networking | Service orchestration |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Infrastructure setup (Docker, database)\n2. Card model with fractional indexing\n3. Card move logic\n4. Drag-and-drop hook\n5. Card movement between columns\n6. Optimistic updates\n7. Drag-and-drop testing\n8. Frontend coverage verification\n9. End-to-end verification\n\n### 5.5 Parallel Execution Opportunities\n\n| Parallel Group | Tasks | Rationale |\n|----------------|-------|-----------|\n| **Infrastructure** | KB-P003, KB-P004 | Backend and frontend init are independent |\n| **Models** | KB-B001, KB-B003, KB-B005 | All models depend on KB-P005, independent of each other |\n| **Routes** | KB-B002, KB-B004, KB-B006 | Routes depend on their models, independent of each other |\n| **Frontend Core** | KB-F007, KB-F008 | Modal and AddCardForm are independent after KB-F005 |\n| **Reports Components** | KB-F020-KB-F023, KB-F024 | Grid features and metrics are independent after KB-F018 |\n| **Backend Tests** | KB-T001-KB-T008 | All backend tests can run in parallel |\n| **Frontend Tests** | KB-T010-KB-T015 | All frontend tests can run in parallel |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quality Requirements\n\n### 6.1 Testing Requirements\n\n| Category | Requirement | Target | Verification |\n|----------|-------------|--------|--------------|\n| Backend Unit Tests | Model and utility tests | >= 80% coverage | Jest --coverage |\n| Backend Integration Tests | API endpoint tests | All endpoints covered | Jest with supertest |\n| Frontend Unit Tests | Component tests | >= 70% coverage | Jest --coverage |\n| Frontend Integration Tests | Hook integration tests | Critical paths covered | React Testing Library |\n\n### 6.2 Code Quality Standards\n\n| Standard | Requirement | Enforcement |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Linting | ESLint with recommended rules | Pre-commit hook |\n| Formatting | Prettier | Pre-commit hook |\n| Type Safety | JSDoc annotations for complex functions | Code review |\n| Documentation | README, API docs, inline comments | Code review |\n\n### 6.3 Security Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Implementation | Verification |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------|\n| SQL Injection Prevention | Parameterized queries only | Code review |\n| XSS Prevention | React auto-escaping, sanitize user input | Code review |\n| CORS Configuration | Whitelist frontend origin only | Integration test |\n| Error Information Leakage | No stack traces in production errors | Integration test |\n| Input Validation | Validate all request bodies | Unit tests |\n\n### 6.4 Performance Requirements\n\n| Metric | Target | Measurement |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| API Response Time | < 200ms for CRUD operations | Integration test timing |\n| Drag-and-Drop Latency | < 100ms UI feedback | Manual testing |\n| Reports Grid Load | < 2s for 1000 rows | Performance test with seed data |\n| Initial Page Load | < 3s on local network | Lighthouse audit |\n| Database Queries | < 50ms per query | Query logging |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Risk Assessment\n\n### 7.1 PRD Risks with Technical Mitigations\n\n| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Technical Mitigation |\n|----|------|------------|--------|---------------------|\n| R1 | Drag-and-drop complexity with HTML5 API | Medium | High | Implement fallback to @dnd-kit library if HTML5 DnD proves insufficient; create abstraction layer in useDragDrop hook |\n| R2 | Fractional indexing precision limits | Low | Medium | Implement automatic position rebalancing when diff < 0.001; use FLOAT for positions with sufficient precision |\n| R3 | AG Grid learning curve | Medium | Low | Follow official AG Grid React documentation; start with basic configuration, add features incrementally |\n| R4 | Docker networking issues on different platforms | Medium | Medium | Test on Linux, macOS, Windows during development; document known issues and workarounds; use standard Docker networking |\n| R5 | Test coverage targets not met | Medium | Medium | Write tests alongside implementation (TDD approach); use Jest coverage reports for tracking; create dedicated testing phase |\n\n### 7.2 Technical Risks\n\n| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|----|------|------------|--------|------------|\n| TR1 | Database connection pool exhaustion | Low | High | Configure appropriate pool size (10-20 connections); implement connection timeout; add health checks |\n| TR2 | Frontend state synchronization issues | Medium | Medium | Implement optimistic updates with rollback; use single source of truth pattern; add error boundaries |\n| TR3 | CORS misconfiguration blocking requests | Low | High | Test CORS configuration early in development; document allowed origins; add CORS debugging middleware |\n| TR4 | AG Grid bundle size impact | Low | Medium | Use AG Grid Community (smaller than Enterprise); implement code splitting for reports route |\n| TR5 | Position rebalance transaction failures | Low | Medium | Wrap rebalance in database transaction; add retry logic; implement position validation |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Non-Goals\n\nThe following are explicitly out of scope for this implementation. Implementation agents will reference this list to reject scope creep.\n\n| ID | Non-Goal | Rationale |\n|----|----------|-----------|\n| NG1 | User authentication/authorization | MVP focuses on single-user local deployment |\n| NG2 | Real-time collaboration/WebSockets | Adds complexity; not needed for single-user |\n| NG3 | Mobile-native applications | Web responsive is sufficient for MVP |\n| NG4 | Cloud deployment configurations | Focus is local Docker development |\n| NG5 | Card attachments/file uploads | Adds storage complexity; defer to future version |\n| NG6 | Due dates, labels, or card metadata beyond title/description | Keep MVP simple; extend later |\n| NG7 | Board templates or column presets | Users can create columns manually |\n| NG8 | Undo/redo functionality | Standard browser back not sufficient; complex to implement |\n| NG9 | Keyboard shortcuts for drag-and-drop | Mouse/touch is sufficient for MVP |\n| NG10 | Dark mode or theme customization | Single light theme for MVP |\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Document Structure**\n- Version 1.0.0, Draft status\n- Task ID prefix: **KB** (Kanban Board)\n- Source PRD linked\n\n**2. Architecture Diagrams (Mermaid)**\n- Architecture Overview (graph TB) - showing 3-tier architecture\n- Data Flow Diagram (sequenceDiagram) - drag-drop and reports flows\n- Database Schema (erDiagram) - boards, columns, cards relationships\n- Execution Plan (gantt) - full parallelization map\n\n**3. Master Task List (57 tasks)**\n- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure Setup (7 tasks: KB-P001 to KB-P007)\n- **Phase 2**: Backend API (12 tasks: KB-B001 to KB-B012)\n- **Phase 3**: Frontend Core (10 tasks: KB-F001 to KB-F010)\n- **Phase 4**: Drag-and-Drop (6 tasks: KB-F011 to KB-F016)\n- **Phase 5**: Reports Dashboard (10 tasks: KB-F017 to KB-F026)\n- **Phase 6**: Testing (18 tasks: KB-T001 to KB-T018)\n\n**4. Parallelization Opportunities Identified**\n- Backend and frontend infrastructure can initialize in parallel\n- Board, Column, Card models can be developed in parallel\n- Reports components (sorting, filtering, pagination) are independent\n- Backend tests and frontend tests can run in parallel\n\n**5. Critical Path**\n```\nKB-P001 -> KB-P002 -> KB-P005 -> KB-B005 -> KB-B007 -> KB-F011 -> KB-F014 -> KB-F016 -> KB-T014 -> KB-T016 -> KB-T018\n```\n\n**6. Imported from PRD**\n- All 10 Non-Goals (NG1-NG10) for scope creep prevention\n- All 5 Risks (R1-R5) with technical mitigations\n- 5 additional Technical Risks (TR1-TR5)\n\n**7. Quality Requirements**\n- Backend: >= 80% test coverage\n- Frontend: >= 70% test coverage\n- API response time < 200ms\n- Grid load < 2s for 1000 rows\n\n**8. Agent Assignments**\n- @backend-implementer: Infrastructure, Backend API, Models\n- @frontend-implementer: Frontend components, Drag-drop, Reports\n- @verify-app: All testing tasks\n\nThe state file has been updated to reflect TRD creation at `.trd-state/current.json`."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":457,"cache_read_input_tokens":55082,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":457,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXC4xsbZnxYjqvwoGdtVj","type":"assistant","uuid":"2104ca44-4d7e-4d7c-a69b-c387d15a3068","timestamp":"2026-01-17T01:18:28.949Z"}
