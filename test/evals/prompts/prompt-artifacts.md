# Artifact Quality Evaluation

Evaluate the PRD and TRD artifacts generated by the full-workflow process.

## Workspace
Path: {workspace_path}

## Artifacts to Evaluate
Review these files (use Read tool):
- docs/PRD/*.md
- docs/TRD/*.md

## Instructions

1. Use the Read tool to find and examine PRD/TRD files
2. Score each artifact type using the detailed rubrics below
3. Return your evaluation as JSON

## Scoring Scale

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Slop | Barely useful, missing sections, vague |
| 2 | Junior | Basic structure, needs significant refinement |
| 3 | Mid-Level | Good working document, clear and actionable |
| 4 | Senior | Comprehensive, well-organized, anticipates issues |
| 5 | Exceptional | Exemplary, could use as template |

**Modifier**: -0.25 (weak), 0 (solid), +0.25 (strong)

## Dimension Rubrics

### PRD Quality (50% weight)
Evaluate: completeness, clarity, acceptance criteria, user focus

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Missing sections, unclear goals, no acceptance criteria, no user stories |
| 2 | Basic structure, some requirements, vague criteria, minimal user focus |
| 3 | Complete sections, clear requirements, testable criteria, user stories present |
| 4 | Comprehensive, excellent user stories, measurable outcomes, stakeholder-ready |
| 5 | Exemplary PRD, perfect clarity, could present to executives |

### TRD Quality (50% weight)
Evaluate: technical accuracy, implementation plan, dependencies, testability

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Vague technical approach, no clear plan, missing dependencies |
| 2 | Basic technical outline, some gaps, incomplete task breakdown |
| 3 | Clear technical approach, actionable tasks, dependencies identified |
| 4 | Excellent architecture decisions, comprehensive plan, risk mitigation |
| 5 | Textbook TRD, could implement without questions, anticipates all issues |
