# Baseline Code Evaluation

You are evaluating code generated by an AI assistant without framework assistance.

## Workspace
Path: {workspace_path}

## Files to Evaluate
Review ONLY these files (use Read tool):
{file_list}

**Ignore**: Any files in `.claude/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.git/`, or auto-generated config files.

## Instructions

1. Use the Read tool to examine each file listed above
2. Score each dimension using the detailed rubrics below
3. Return your evaluation as JSON

## Scoring Scale

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Slop | Works but messy. Anti-patterns, no docs, poor naming. |
| 2 | Junior | Acceptable/functional. Basic structure, some docs. |
| 3 | Mid-Level | Good, solid work. Clean code, proper docs, production-ready. |
| 4 | Senior | High quality. Excellent patterns, comprehensive tests. |
| 5 | Exceptional | Best-in-class. Elegant, simplified, performant. |

**Modifier**: -0.25 (weak for level), 0 (solid), +0.25 (strong for level)

## Dimension Rubrics

### Code Quality (35% weight)
Evaluate: readability, naming conventions, documentation, type hints, idiomatic patterns

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Single-letter variables, no docstrings, inconsistent style, violates language conventions |
| 2 | Basic naming, sparse comments, works but not clean, mixed conventions |
| 3 | Clear names, good docstrings, consistent style, type hints present |
| 4 | Comprehensive docs, elegant patterns, excellent readability, idiomatic code |
| 5 | Perfect documentation, could teach from this code, exemplary style |

### Architecture (30% weight)
Evaluate: modularity, separation of concerns, extensibility, dependency management

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Monolithic, tangled logic, hard to extend, circular dependencies |
| 2 | Some structure but responsibilities mixed, unclear boundaries |
| 3 | Clear separation, single responsibility, reasonable modularity |
| 4 | Excellent modularity, easy to extend, clean interfaces, SOLID principles |
| 5 | Textbook architecture, anticipates future needs, elegant abstractions |

### Test Quality (25% weight)
Evaluate: coverage, edge cases, assertions, organization, use of fixtures/parametrize

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Minimal tests, happy path only, poor organization, no fixtures |
| 2 | Basic coverage, some edge cases, simple assertions |
| 3 | Good coverage, edge cases handled, uses fixtures, organized by function |
| 4 | Comprehensive coverage, excellent edge cases, parametrized, clear naming |
| 5 | Exemplary test suite, could serve as testing tutorial, property-based tests |

### Error Handling (10% weight)
Evaluate: input validation, error messages, graceful failure, boundary handling

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | No validation, crashes on bad input, generic exceptions |
| 2 | Basic validation, generic error messages, some boundary handling |
| 3 | Proper validation, helpful errors, handles boundaries gracefully |
| 4 | Comprehensive validation, excellent error messages, defensive coding |
| 5 | Bulletproof, anticipates all edge cases, user-friendly errors, recoverable |
