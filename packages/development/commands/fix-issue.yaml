mission:
  summary: |
    Orchestrate a complete bug fix workflow from analysis to PR creation,
    assembling a virtual team of specialized agents (Product Manager, Tech Lead,
    Architect, QA Lead) to ensure high-quality fixes with minimal user intervention.

  behavior:
    - Execute 3-phase workflow - Analysis & Planning, Execution, Validation & Delivery
    - Delegate codebase analysis to general-purpose agent (Haiku for speed)
    - Assemble 4-agent team for collaborative planning (Sonnet for quality)
    - Conduct user interview only if description is ambiguous or --interactive flag set
    - Create git branch following convention - fix/issue-{num}-{slug}
    - Generate actionable task list and track progress with TodoWrite
    - Delegate implementation to appropriate agents (backend, frontend, infrastructure)
    - Run test suite with auto-fix retry logic (max 2 attempts)
    - Create comprehensive PR with GitHub CLI
    - Provide clear error messages and recovery guidance

  constraints:
    - GitHub only (no GitLab/Bitbucket in v1.0)
    - GitHub CLI (gh) must be installed and authenticated
    - Tests must pass unless --skip-tests flag is used
    - Maximum 2 auto-fix attempts for test failures
    - User interview limited to 5 questions maximum
    - Branch naming follows fixed convention (customizable via --branch)

      description: Understand codebase context and create comprehensive fix plan

      steps:
        - order: 1
          title: Codebase Analysis
          description: |
            Explore codebase to identify affected files, patterns, and scope.
            Use Grep, Glob, and Read tools to understand context.
          agent: general-purpose
          model: haiku
          instructions: |
            1. Extract keywords from issue description
            2. Search codebase for relevant files (Grep)
            3. Identify related test files
            4. Detect framework and testing patterns (package.json, imports)
            5. Estimate scope (file count, estimated LOC)
            6. Return structured analysis result

        - order: 2
          title: Collaborative Planning
          description: |
            Assemble virtual team of 4 specialized agents to create comprehensive
            fix plan with multiple perspectives.
          model: sonnet
          instructions: |
            Delegate planning to 4 agents in sequence:

            1. Task(product-management-orchestrator)
               - Validate problem statement
               - Define acceptance criteria
               - Identify user impact and edge cases

            2. Task(tech-lead-orchestrator)
               - Review technical approach
               - Ensure consistency with codebase patterns
               - Validate feasibility

            3. Task(infrastructure-orchestrator)
               - Evaluate architecture implications
               - Identify dependencies and integration points
               - Assess scalability and maintainability

            4. Task(qa-orchestrator)
               - Define test coverage requirements
               - Create test strategy
               - Identify quality gates

            Synthesize responses into unified plan with:
            - Approach summary
            - Files to modify
            - Test strategy
            - Edge cases to handle

        - order: 3
          title: User Interview (Conditional)
          description: |
            If issue description is ambiguous or --interactive flag is set,
            ask clarifying questions (max 5).
          conditional: true
          trigger: |
            Ambiguity detection:
            - Description < 20 words
            - Vague terms ("doesn't work", "broken", "issue")
            - Multiple possible interpretations
            - OR --interactive flag is set
          instructions: |
            1. Generate 3-5 focused questions
            2. Use AskUserQuestion tool
            3. Incorporate responses into plan
            4. Update approach and acceptance criteria

      order: 2
      description: Create branch, generate tasks, and implement fix

      steps:
        - order: 1
          title: Branch Creation
          description: Create git branch with conventional naming
          tool: Bash
          instructions: |
            1. Generate branch name:
               - IF --branch flag: Use custom name
               - ELIF --issue flag: fix/issue-{number}-{slugified-description}
               - ELSE: fix/{slugified-description}

            2. Check if branch exists:
               - git branch --list {branch-name}
               - If exists: Ask user to switch or use different name

            3. Create branch:
               - git checkout -b {branch-name}
               - Verify creation: git branch --show-current

        - order: 2
          title: Task List Generation
          description: Break down plan into actionable tasks
          tool: TodoWrite
          instructions: |
            Generate 3-10 specific, actionable tasks from plan:

            Format:
            - content: "Update timeout.ts constant from 30s to 60s"
              activeForm: "Updating timeout constant"
              status: "pending"

            Include:
            - Implementation tasks (file modifications)
            - Test update tasks
            - Validation tasks

            Each task should be:
            - Specific to a file or component
            - Actionable (clear what to do)
            - Testable (clear success criteria)

        - order: 3
          title: Task Execution
          description: |
            Execute all tasks with appropriate agent delegation and
            real-time progress tracking.
          model: sonnet
          instructions: |
            FOR EACH task in task list:

            1. Mark task as in_progress:
               TodoWrite({ taskId: X, status: "in_progress" })

            2. Select appropriate agent:
               - Backend code → backend-developer
               - Frontend code → frontend-developer
               - Infrastructure → infrastructure-developer
               - Generic → general-purpose

            3. Delegate task:
               Task(agent-type, prompt=task.content)

            4. Mark task as completed:
               TodoWrite({ taskId: X, status: "completed" })

            5. IF task fails:
               - Keep status as "in_progress"
               - Log error details
               - Continue with remaining tasks
               - Report failures at end

          model: haiku
          retry: 2
          instructions: |
            1. Detect test framework:
               - Check package.json for jest, pytest, rspec, etc.
               - Check for test files and imports
               - Determine test command (npm test, pytest, rspec)

            2. Run tests (Attempt 1):
               - Bash({test-command})
               - Parse output for pass/fail

            3. IF tests fail:
               - Analyze failure output
               - Identify root causes
               - Attempt fixes (Edit files)
               - Run tests again (Attempt 2)

            4. IF tests still fail after 2 attempts:
               - Report failures to user with details
               - HALT workflow (do not create PR)
               - Provide recovery instructions

            5. IF --skip-tests flag:
               - Log warning message
               - Skip test execution
               - Proceed to PR creation
