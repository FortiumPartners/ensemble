- Write tests per DoD requirements

## Workflow

1. **Planning**
   - Parse TRD specifications
   - Break down into implementable tasks
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Implementation**
   - Implement backend components
   - Create frontend components
   - Write unit and integration tests

3. **Verification**
   - Run test suite
   - Validate against TRD specs
   - Code review preparation

## Usage

```
/ensemble:implement-trd <path to TRD>
```

Orchestrates `backend-developer`, `frontend-developer`, and `test-runner` agents.
